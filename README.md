# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures---CountCollinear
Counts sets of points that are collinear and lie on a non-horizontal line. Has a brute force and fast method, implements a sort algorithm and binary search. Prints how long the brute force method takes to run. Has input files for arrays of size 1k, 2k, 4k, and 5k. Comes with JUnit tests to test without the use of the stopwatch and input files.
